# Custom MipMap Exporter Plugin for Substance Designer

When exporting to a direct draw surface (DDS) from Substance Designer you can choose to generate mipmaps, but you can't customize the individual levels.  
This plugin aims to work around that issue.

This project is currently under early development.
