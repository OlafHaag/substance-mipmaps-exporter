# DDS Exporter Plugin with custom MipMaps for Substance Designer

When exporting to a direct draw surface (DDS) from Substance Designer, MipMaps aren't supported.
The exported image also does not seem to be compressed.

The settings for MipMaps generation in Designer only serve as a marker for third party software integrations of the Substance Engine.
It has no influence on the generation of dds files in Designer. 

This plugin aims to work around that issue.  
This project is currently __under early development__.
